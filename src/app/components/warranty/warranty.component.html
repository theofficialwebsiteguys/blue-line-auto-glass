      <h2>Limited Warranty</h2>
      <p>
        Your automotive glass installed by Blue Line Auto Glass is warranted against defects in material and workmanship for as long as you own the vehicle in which the glass is installed. Defects must be brought to the attention of Blue Line Auto Glass within 30 days of your discovery of the defect. This windshield warranty applies as long as you own or lease the vehicle on which the repair was made and is not transferrable.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may contact us at <strong>(602) 237-6130</strong>, and we will replace or repair the warranted product or correct the defective workmanship without charge at a mutually agreed upon time.

          If damage or rust is discovered in the pinch weld, this warranty does not cover any leaks, stress cracks, or related damage in connection with installations to this vehicle. We will notify you of the existence of such damage or rust prior to removal of existing glass if it is noticed; however, it is often not possible to do this. Blue Line Auto Glass is not responsible for any associated damage in these cases.

          In the event that we perform a recalibration, it is guaranteed for one year after recalibration or until the next recalibration event, whichever occurs first. If you experience a recalibration event, your advanced safety systems may not work correctly and you should contact a qualified recalibration specialist.
